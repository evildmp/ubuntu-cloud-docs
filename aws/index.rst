Ubuntu on AWS
=============


**Ubuntu on AWS is a set of customised Ubuntu images** that allow easy access to a wide range 
of products and services - offered by both Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Canonical.

**These images provide a foundation for deploying cloud-based software solutions,** specifically
for softwares built on Ubuntu and running on AWS. They focus on providing the optimal tools 
and features needed to run specific workloads.

**The images create a stable and secure cloud platform** that is ideal for scaling development work
done on Ubuntu-based systems. Since Ubuntu is one of the most favoured operating systems amongst
developers, using an Ubuntu-based image for the corresponding cloud deployment becomes the simplest
option.

**Everyone from individual developers to large enterprises use these images** for developing and deploying
their softwares. For highly regulated industries from the government, medical and finance sectors, 
various security-certified images are also available.

Canonical's offerings on AWS
----------------------------

Ubuntu images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We provide images for:

* **EC2** - these are customised machine images (AMIs), based on an AWS-optimised kernel. Includes improved device drivers 
  and out of the box support for accelerators like GPUs.

* **EKS** optimised AMIs for running Kubernetes, using a custom kernel. The image is slimmed-down and optimised for 
  performance and security on EKS clusters.

For each Ubuntu release, multiple Ubuntu images are delivered to AWS. This could be based on the underlying architecture, required features, the storage type and the virtualisation type that is used. For example, a non-exhaustive list is:

* **architectures** - AMD64, ARM64, Graviton
* **Ubuntu image types** - server, minimal
* etc...
* **support/security compliance level** - standard, Ubuntu Pro, Ubuntu Pro FIPS

Ubuntu Pro
~~~~~~~~~~
`Ubuntu Pro for AWS`_ are premium images from Canonical that includes certified components, hardening options,  comprehensive open source security coverage (for packages in main and universe) for 10 years, kernel Livepatch service and optional 24/7 enterprise-grade support. These images are available on AMD64 and Graviton architectures.


Ubuntu Pro FIPS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Ubuntu Pro FIPS for AWS`_ are FIPS certified images created by Canonical for AWS compliance in production environments. These premium images are available only through the AWS Marketplace or through private offers.


Ubuntu Workspace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Ubuntu Workspaces`_ are virtual Ubuntu desktops powered by AWS. Workspaces is a paid offering supported through `Amazon Workspaces`_ and the image provided for Workspaces is basically an Ubuntu Desktop running on EC2, with Ubuntu Pro services (ESM, livepatch) enabled by default.

Anbox
~~~~~

`Anbox`_ is Android containers in the cloud. There are 2 AWS marketplace listings available to deploy Anbox directly on AWS:

* `Anbox Cloud - AMD64`_
* `Anbox Cloud - ARM64`_

EKS image retention policy
--------------------------

There are multiple EKS images available for every EKS Kubernetes version (1.23, 1.24, ...). When an EKS Kubernetes version is no longer `supported by AWS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html>`_,
all the images for that unsupported version are deleted from the Canonical AWS account, except for the latest released one.

Say the currently available images under the Canonical AWS account are::


    ubuntu-eks/k8s_1.24/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-arm64-server-20221214
    ubuntu-eks/k8s_1.24/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-arm64-server-20221206.1
    ubuntu-eks/k8s_1.23/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-arm64-server-20221214
    ubuntu-eks/k8s_1.23/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-arm64-server-20221011
    ubuntu-eks/k8s_1.23/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-arm64-server-20220822.2


If EKS 1.23 is no longer supported, it would result in the deletion of the following two images::

    ubuntu-eks/k8s_1.23/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-arm64-server-20221011
    ubuntu-eks/k8s_1.23/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-arm64-server-20220822.2

but the latest image ``ubuntu-eks/k8s_1.23/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-arm64-server-20221214`` would still exist.
